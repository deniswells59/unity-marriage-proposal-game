  NPCScene:
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Okay, uhm, can you explain it again?
  - name: Rory
    sentence: 'Yes. Kirk has started his own crypto currency and he wants to set up
      every business in town to accept it as a form of payment. '
  - name: Rory
    sentence: But I think it could destabilize our economy because of how volatile
      the value is. Jay Adkinson wrote a very interesting article about crypto and
      it reads more like a horror story than a finance piece.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: '"Crypto"? We''re just calling it "crypto" now?'
  - name: Rory
    sentence: Hey, you gotta keep up with the times, kid. Read a little, stay educated.
      Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy century.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Coming from the girl wearing her old high school uniform...
  - name: Rory
    sentence: Hey! Laundry came up fast and this is all I had left in my closet. Besides,
      it wouldn't be a big deal if my mother would've just loaned me some clothes...
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Well, last time I let you borrow that blue dress, you looked so good
      in it that I was never able to wear it again. And where is it now?
  - name: Rory
    sentence: About 20 minutes into a rinse cycle between my Yale sweat pants and
      a Mystic Pizza t-shirt.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Right. So now you're going to run around all day and take solace in
      the fact that you STILL fit into an outfit that you wore when you were 18.
  - name: Rory
    sentence: And rub everyone's faces in it!
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: That's my girl.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Oh! There's someone standing here.
  - name: Rory
    sentence: Oh my gosh. We're so completely self-absorbed and in our own world that
      we didn't even notice someone standing here.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Hi! I'm Lorelai! If you're new in town, you should come check out the
      Dragonfly Inn. Maybe get a room there and stay a while.
  - name: Rory
    sentence: She can't, mom. She's on an adventure. Go explore the town and meet
      some of Stars Hollow's finest! Right now, the town is throwing a party to celebrate
      the release of Kirk's latest cryto currrency.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Oh right. "Latest". I hope he learned his lesson. I think he's still
      paying back Al's Pancake World from the fallout of his Hollows-Coin...
  - name: Rory
    sentence: Kirk never learns his lesson. I think that's a part of his charm.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: Sure, if that's what you wanna call it.
  - name: Lorelai
    sentence: So, nice to meet you! Uh, I hope you find what you're looking for!
  - name: Rory
    sentence: Oh yeah, person. Good luck!
