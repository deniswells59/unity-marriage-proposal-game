  - name: Emily
    sentence: Richard! Do not invest any money into this joke of a company! The more
      you talk to this "Kirk" character, the more I don't trust him.
  - name: Richard
    sentence: Well, I might do just that! I'm not certain about this Kirk-Coin, in
      particular. But I watched Hanlin turn $1,000 into $20,000 by investing in a
      currency called "Bitcoin".
  - name: Emily
    sentence: You have no experience in something like this! You've only become ambitious
      about crypto currency because of that drink in your hand!
  - name: Richard
    sentence: Ha, that is true. Say what you will about Ms. Paddy, but she sure knows
      how to make a delightful "party punch".
  - name: Richard
    sentence: What is this? Our fourth glass?
  - name: Emily
    sentence: Whatever it is, it's our last! I have a D.A.R. meeting tonight and I'll
      be damned if I show up as "juiced" as Tweeny Halpern was last week.
  - name: Richard
    sentence: I doubt that Tweeny Halpern was celebrating one of the greatest local
      ventures such as Kirk-Coin! In fact, I intend to have the largest Kirk-Wallet
      by the end of this day! Just try to stop me!
  - name: Emily
    sentence: Richard! Please!
